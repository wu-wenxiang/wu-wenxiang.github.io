## Short Brief Introduction

### Why do choose IT?

My uncle gave me an old 386 computer as a gift when I was in middle school, then I fell in love at first sight. It was the most interesting & exciting toy that I never met before. I installed WPS, a text editor software, then wrote diaries. Nobody could see it because I add a password to encrypt them.

In high middle school, I began to study programming. After knowing how to control for-loop & if-else syntax, I even feel I could control the world. The first language I learned was Pascal, a perfect teaching language at that time. 

In university, I spent too much time on computer games, like Starcraft, Diablo & online go. I remember one day, I started to play online go in the morning, about 8 o'clock, then I never left until 4 o'clock on the next morning. I still did not feel any tired, my wife, at that time, she was my girl friend, she pull off the cable, then shout at me: go to sleep!

So, that why I choose IT. I like computer as a toy when I was young, I like programming because I'm good at it, I could communicate with all of the computer genius over the world. Linus have a famous words: talk is cheap, show me the code. I like to explain my opinions with the code. I also had liked computer games nearly crazy. However, now, I gave up computer games, only do programming, it's my job, also one of my hobbies, what a lucky things! :)
