## Job

### Explain more about my current job

We check troubleshooting cases from a internal tool every day. Once a case being accepted, we would call or email with  our customers to know the symptom of the issue they met. Then we would do the first sight judge, give a conclusion or trace collection action plan for further analysis. Basically, we have to analysis traces, dumps & review codes to find the root cause & solution to help our customer fix their issues.

We also deliver some POC(Proof of concept) projects or deliver training to our customer, both online and onsite.

### Why do choose IT?

My uncle gave me an old 386 computer as a gift when I was in middle school, then I fell in love at first sight. It was the most interesting & exciting toy that I never met before. I installed WPS, a text editor software, then wrote diaries. Nobody could see them because I add a password to encrypt the files.

In high middle school, I began to study programming. After knowing how to control for-loop & if-else syntax, I even feel I could control the world. The first language I learned was Pascal, a perfect teaching language at that time. 

In university, I spent too much time on computer games, like Starcraft, Diablo & online go. I remember one day, I started to play online go in the morning, about 8 o'clock, then I never left until 4 o'clock on the next morning. I still did not feel any tired, my wife, at that time, she was my girl friend, she pull off the cable, then shout at me: go to sleep!

So, that why I choose IT. I like computer as a toy when I was young, I like programming because I'm good at it, I could communicate with all of the computer genius over the world. Linus have a famous words: talk is cheap, show me the code. I like to explain my opinions with the code. I also had liked computer games nearly crazy. However, now, I gave up computer games, only do programming, it's my job, also one of my hobbies, what a lucky things! :)

## Education

## Family

My grandfather was a pastry maker (a kind of Chinese cookie) & an accountant. He was educated from traditional old-style private school which teaches reading, writing & mathematics. He liked finishing, handwriting & Chinese classics. He could recite the whole Taohuayuanji even 90 years old. He told a lot of stories about history & heroes to me when I was very young. I could remember most of them even now (Romance of the Three Kingdoms, The Canonization of the Gods, The Water Margin, The Biography of Diqing & XueRengui). He don't like The Dream of Red Mansion because he believe boys should hard work for families rather than play with his servant girls all days.

My grandmother was a very kind-heart woman. She would like to help everyone who ask help, so all people in our village like her. She passed away when I was 11, I missed her very much for a long time.

My father is a cook, he is good at Huai-Yang cuisine style. He is a very smart guy, he could build houses, make furniture & repair almost every thing in our life except computer things. He suffered from bronchial inflammation since very young, which limited his further achievements. He would be very unhappy when encounter any bad news, & also very happy when receive any good news, like a young guy.

My mother is a strong woman. She has 2 brothers & 2 sisters. She only learned 5 years in school but she learns good. She couldn't study more when she was young, so she always ask me to study hard. She worked very hard these years. Her hobby are playing poker & watching TV, however if any farming thing have to do, she would go to farm firstly.

My wife is a children teacher. She is a kind-heart woman too, sometimes over kind-heart. She like eating delicious foods, traveling, watching TV & shopping. I love her, even I think she has a little lazy.

My daughter is a clever girl. She want to play with us or other children every time. I love her.
